# create-a-modern-conversational-ui-with-dotnet-maui-chat-control
Learn how to create modern chat layouts and bind messages with various formats, including text, images, and more. Additionally, discover how to dynamically send messages using external textboxes and buttons.

## Sample

```xaml  

     <Grid RowDefinitions="50, *" ColumnDefinitions="0.7*,0.3*">
        <Entry x:Name="entry"></Entry>
        <Button Grid.Row="0" Grid.Column="1"
                Text="Send"
                WidthRequest="100"
                Margin="2"
                Clicked="Button_Clicked"></Button>
        <sf:SfChat Grid.Row="1" Grid.ColumnSpan="2"
            Messages="{Binding Messages}"
            CurrentUser="{Binding Reciver}"
            ShowTimeBreak="True"></sf:SfChat>
    </Grid>

Code Behind :

    public void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.entry.Text))
        {
            ViewModel.Messages.Add(new TextMessage()
            {
                Author = ViewModel.Sender,
                Text = this.entry.Text,
            }
           );
          this.entry.ClearValue(Entry.TextProperty);
        }
    }
```
